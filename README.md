Calculator
This repository contains code for a simple command-line calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation and finding the nth root of a number. It also has a memory feature that allows you to store a result and use it in further calculations.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Files
Calculator.py: Main code that implements the calculator and its different operations.
action.py: Contains the functions that perform the different operations of the calculator.
test.py: A unittest module that tests the functionality of the functions in action.py.
How to use
Run the Calculator.py file from the command line.
Select the operation you would like to perform by entering the corresponding number.
Enter the two numbers you would like to perform the operation on.
The result will be displayed and you can use it in further calculations by using the memory feature.
To reset the memory, select option 8. To exit the calculator, select option 9.
Test
Run the test.py file to run the unittest tests.
The tests check the functionality of the functions in action.py and will display OK if the tests pass.
